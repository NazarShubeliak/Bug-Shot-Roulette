# Bug Shot Roulette (Parody)

**Bug Shot Roulette** is a simple parody of the game **Bug Shot Roulette**, created using the **Pygame** library. The goal of the game is to guess which target will be hit by the "signal" button and score the most points by quickly and accurately responding to each challenge.

## Description
